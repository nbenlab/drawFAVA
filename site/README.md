# Website Build Directory

This directory is a placeholder for the built website documents. This
repository uses `jupyter-book` to build the webpage, and this directory is
where the built pages go, typically in a subdirectory named `_build`. The
`_build` directory is listed in the repository's `.gitignore` file, so it won't
be tracked by `git` (and shouldn't be)`.
