# The Annotations

This directory contains the annotations of the visual areas, stored as
tab-separated value files in directories for each user who made the
annotations.

On the `main` branch of the central (`nbenlab`) repository, this directory will
be empty. On the `main` branch of forks of this repository made by annotators
will be a directory for their username containing their annotations. On the
`data` branch for the central repository, we will collect all of the
annotations.
