# The DrawFAVA Project

This is the website for the DrawFAVA project. The "FAVA" in DrawFAVA stands for
the **Functional Atlas of Visual Areas**&mdash;a dataset of annotations on
human brains describing their visual function. (For more information, see the
[project overview](intro:overview).) The DrawFAVA project is simply the project
to draw the annotations that will make up this dataset.

On this page, you will find information about the FAVA dataset and instructions
on how to draw the annotations for the project. This page is primarily intended
for the researchers who are drawing the annotations, but other researchers may
find the resources useful as well.
